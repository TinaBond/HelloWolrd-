workflow for course SoftServe
-----------------------------
I started this study with great enthusiasm in May 2022. 
<br> I continue this along with studying at other courses.
<br> I really like the work of the teacher [@koldovsky](https://github.com/koldovsky) and the level of explanations for the material
